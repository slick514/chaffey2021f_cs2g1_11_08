 * Course: Chaffey College 2021-Fall CS2

 * Project: 11.08
 * Coder: Justin Gries

 * Prompt:
 * Implement an iterator that produces the moves for the Towers of Hanoi puzzle described in Worked Example 11.2.
 * Provide functions has_more_moves and next_move. The next_move function should yield a string describing the next
 * move. For example, the following code prints all moves needed to move five disks from peg 1 to peg 3:
 DiskMover mover(5, 1, 3);
 while (mover.has_more_moves())
 {
    cout << mover.next_move() << endl;
 }
 Hint: A disk mover that moves a single disk from one peg to another simply has a next_move function that returns a
 string

 Move disk from peg source to target
 A disk mover with more than one disk to move must work harder. It needs another DiskMover to help it move the first
 d â€“ 1 disks. Then next_move asks that disk mover for its next move until it is done. Then the next_move function
 issues a command to move the dth disk. Finally, it constructs another disk mover that generates the remaining moves.
